# The City of Fylakistike

The City of Fylakistike is a campaign setting for my TTRPGs based around Dungeons & Dragons lore and mechanics. The amount of information has become too much for my players to handle so here we are! This is a wiki page mainly for my players to use :)

#### Cosmology and Religion
To escape a cataclysmic event, a group of demigods, also referred to as the [[chosen of the gods\|chosen of the gods]], created the City of Fylakistike, a safe haven for the world's surviving beings. In hopes that the survivors can recuperate and reclaim the outside world again.

The people of Fylakistike worship the [[02. Cosmology & Culture/Deities\|Greek pantheon]]. Even though they have been silent since the creation of the dome, the people still honor them with numerous [[02. Cosmology & Culture/Holidays\|holidays and festivals]]. There are celebrations attributed to [[01. Overview/City of Fylakistike\|the heroes]] as well.

#### Geography
The City of Fylakistike is encased in a sphere made out of a thick layer of crystals, more often referred to as [[02. Cosmology & Culture/Technology#The Crystalline Dome\|the dome]]. At the very top of the sphere, there is an opening that allows for natural sunlight to shine through. 

There are four layers to the dome, also referred to by my players as: [[03. Geography/Level 1 - The Level Upper\|The Level Upper]], [[03. Geography/Level 2 - The Level In-Between\|The Level In-Between]], [[03. Geography/Level 3 - The Third Wheel\|The Third Wheel]], and [[03. Geography/Level 4 - Deep Down Dark Deep Down\|Deep Down Dark Deep Down]]. Each level is connected by a massive hollow central shaft that allows sunlight to filter down through all layers. [[03. Geography/Level 0 - The Facility\|The Facility]], which acts as the central government, is suspended in the central shaft between the 1st and 2nd layer upon a giant floating island.

Each layer has 4 sectors

#### Inhabitants
The creatures of the dome are separated into two categories, intelligent and unintelligent creatures. A creature is considered intelligent when they can learn and understand languages. Intelligent creatures are residences of the dome while the unintelligent ones are considered cattle.

# The City of Fylakistike

The City of Fylakistike is a campaign setting for my TTRPGs based around Dungeons & Dragons lore and mechanics. The amount of information has become too much for my players to handle so here we are! This is a wiki page mainly for my players to use :)

#### Cosmology
To escape a cataclysmic event, a group of demigods, also referred to as the [[chosen of the gods\|chosen of the gods]], created the City of Fylakistike, a safe haven for the world's surviving beings. In hopes that the survivors can recuperate and reclaim the outside world again.

The people of Fylakistike worship the Greek pantheon, 

#### Geography
The City of Fylakistike is encased in a sphere made out of a thick layer of crystals, more often referred to as [[02. Cosmology & Culture/Technology#The Crystalline Dome\|the dome]]. At the very top of the dome, there is an opening that allows for natural sunlight to shine through. 

There are four layers to the dome, also referred to by my players as: [[03. Geography/Layer Overview/Level 1\|The Level Upper]], [[03. Geography/Layer Overview/Level 2\|The Level In-Between]], [[03. Geography/Layer Overview/Level 3\|The Third Wheel]], and [[03. Geography/Layer Overview/Level 4\|Deep Down Dark Deep Down]]. Each level is connected by a massive hollow central shaft that allows sunlight to filter down through all layers. Suspended in the central shaft between the 1st and 2nd layer, referred to as [[03. Geography/Layer Overview/Level 0 - The Facility\|the Facility]] sits upon a giant floating island.

#### Creatures 
The creatures of the dome are separated into two categories, intelligent and unintelligent creatures. A creature is considered intelligent when they can learn and understand languages. Intelligent creatures are residences of the dome while the unintelligent ones are considered cattle.
